        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "This notebook will be used as an introduction to the basic concepts in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Free and Open-source\n",
        "Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license. Hence, it is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. It doesn't cost anything to download Python or to include it in your application. It can also be freely modified and re-distributed. \n",
        "\n",
        "Python can be downloaded from the official Python website https://www.python.org/.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Simple and expressive\n",
        "It is really easy to code in Python. On the other hand, Python code can be read almost like plain English words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python needs to use only a few lines of code to perform complex tasks. For example, to display Hello World, you simply need to type one line `print(\"Hello World\")`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Interpreted and Portable\n",
        "When a programming language is interpreted, it means that the source code is executed line by line, and not all at once.Therefore, here is no need to compile Python because it is processed at runtime by the interpreter. \n",
        "\n",
        "Python code can be used on different machines and environments. You may write a Python code on a Mac and it will run on Windows or Linux without changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Object-Oriented and Procedure-Oriented\n",
        "A programming language is object-oriented if it focuses design around data and objects, rather than functions and logic. On the contrary, a programming language is procedure-oriented if it focuses more on functions (code that can be reused). One of the critical Python features is that it supports both object-oriented and procedure-oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reserved words\n",
        "In Python 3.6 the are 33 reserved words:\n",
        "\n",
        "`and as assert break class continue def del elif else except False finally for from global if import in is lambda match None nonlocal not or pass raise return True try while with yield`\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, **Python code is case sensitive!**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Code indentation\n",
        "**Indentation** refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a **block** of code.\n",
